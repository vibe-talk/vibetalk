            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Why Etiquette Matters in Online Chat</h2>
                <p>Online chat etiquette isn't about following arbitrary rules—it's about creating an environment where meaningful conversations can flourish. Good etiquette leads to better connections, more enjoyable experiences, and safer interactions for everyone.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike in-person conversations, online chat lacks body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. This means that how you express yourself through text carries extra weight. A message that seems harmless to you might come across as rude or aggressive to someone else.</p>
                
                <p>By following basic etiquette principles, you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make conversations more enjoyable for yourself and others</li>
                    <li>Increase the likelihood of meaningful connections</li>
                    <li>Contribute to a positive community culture</li>
                    <li>Reduce misunderstandings and conflicts</li>
                    <li>Build a reputation as someone worth talking to</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Golden Rule:</strong> Treat others online as you would want to be treated. If you wouldn't say it to someone's face, don't type it either.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Do's -->
            <section id="dos">
                <h2>The Do's of Online Chat</h2>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Introduce Yourself Properly</h3>
                <p>Start conversations with a friendly greeting and perhaps a conversation starter. "Hey! I'm interested in music and travel. What brings you here today?" is much better than just "hi" or "asl?"</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Ask Open-Ended Questions</h3>
                <p>Questions that require more than yes/no answers lead to better conversations. "What kind of books do you enjoy?" is better than "Do you like reading?"</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Show Genuine Interest</h3>
                <p>Pay attention to what the other person says and respond thoughtfully. Reference specific things they've mentioned and ask follow-up questions.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Be Patient</h3>
                <p>People have different typing speeds and may be multitasking. Give them time to respond without bombarding them with multiple messages.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Respect Different Perspectives</h3>
                <p>You'll encounter people with different views, backgrounds, and opinions. Approach differences with curiosity rather than judgment.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Use Clear Language</h3>
                <p>Write clearly and avoid excessive abbreviations that might confuse non-native speakers. Proofread before sending to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Be Honest (Within Appropriate Limits)</h3>
                <p>While protecting your personal information, be authentic in what you do share. Don't pretend to be someone you're not.</p>
                
                <h3>✅ Do Know When to Move On</h3>
                <p>Not every conversation will click, and that's okay. It's better to politely end a conversation that isn't working than to force it.</p>

            <!-- Don'ts -->
            <section id="donts">
                <h2>The Don'ts of Online Chat</h2>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Spam or Send Multiple Messages</h3>
                <p>If someone doesn't respond immediately, wait. Sending "?", "hello?", "are you there?" every few seconds is annoying and pushy.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Use All Caps</h3>
                <p>WRITING LIKE THIS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING and is aggressive. Use caps sparingly for emphasis only.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Ask for Personal Information</h3>
                <p>Respect others' privacy. Don't ask for real names, locations, phone numbers, or social media unless they offer first.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Send Unsolicited Photos or Links</h3>
                <p>Never send photos of yourself without permission, and don't send links that could be suspicious. This includes any type of explicit content.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Make Assumptions</h3>
                <p>Don't assume someone's gender, nationality, age, or beliefs. Ask politely if you want to know something.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Be Racist, Sexist, or Discriminatory</h3>
                <p>Hate speech and discrimination have no place in online chat. Treat everyone with respect regardless of their background.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Harass or Pressure</h3>
                <p>If someone declines to discuss a topic, share information, or continue chatting, respect that decision. Persistence is harassment.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Overshare Too Quickly</h3>
                <p>Dumping your life story or intense personal problems on a stranger can be overwhelming. Build up to deeper topics gradually.</p>
                
                <h3>❌ Don't Ghost Rudely</h3>
                <p>If you need to end a conversation, a quick "I need to go, nice talking to you!" is much better than suddenly disappearing mid-conversation.</p>
                
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Behind every username is a real person with feelings. Actions have consequences even when you're anonymous.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Boundaries -->
            <section id="boundaries">
                <h2>Respecting Boundaries</h2>
                <p>Understanding and respecting boundaries is fundamental to positive online interactions.</p>
                
                <h3>Recognizing Boundaries</h3>
                <p>Boundaries can be explicit or implied. Learn to recognize both:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Explicit:</strong> "I don't want to talk about that" or "I'd rather not share"</li>
                    <li><strong>Implied:</strong> Changing the subject, short responses, delayed replies</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Common Boundaries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not sharing personal identifying information</li>
                    <li>Avoiding certain topics (politics, religion, personal trauma)</li>
                    <li>Not wanting to share photos</li>
                    <li>Keeping conversations on the current platform</li>
                    <li>Time limits on availability</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>How to Respond to Boundaries</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge and accept: "No problem, I understand"</li>
                    <li>Don't ask for reasons: You're not owed an explanation</li>
                    <li>Move on gracefully: Change the topic without making it awkward</li>
                    <li>Don't test boundaries: Accept "no" the first time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Setting Your Own Boundaries</h3>
                <p>You have the right to set boundaries too:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be clear and direct: "I don't discuss that with people I just met"</li>
                    <li>You don't need to justify: "I'd rather not" is sufficient</li>
                    <li>End conversations if boundaries are violated</li>
                    <li>Use block and report features when needed</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Anonymity -->
            <section id="anonymity">
                <h2>Maintaining Anonymity</h2>
                <p>Anonymity is both a privilege and a responsibility in online chat. Use it wisely.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Anonymity Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protects your privacy and security</li>
                    <li>Allows more honest expression</li>
                    <li>Reduces social pressure and judgment</li>
                    <li>Creates space for authentic connection</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Respecting Others' Anonymity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't pressure others to reveal personal information</li>
                    <li>Don't attempt to identify someone from clues they share</li>
                    <li>Don't share screenshots or details from private conversations</li>
                    <li>Respect that others may have good reasons for their privacy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Protecting Your Own Anonymity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a username that doesn't reveal personal details</li>
                    <li>Be mindful of information you share inadvertently</li>
                    <li>Don't link to social media profiles</li>
                    <li>Consider the cumulative picture from multiple details</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Anonymity Is Not a License</h3>
                <p>Being anonymous doesn't mean you can behave badly. Remember:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Platforms can track and ban abusive users</li>
                    <li>Serious violations can have legal consequences</li>
                    <li>Your actions affect real people with real feelings</li>
                    <li>Building a reputation still matters for returning users</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Ending Conversations -->
            <section id="ending">
                <h2>Ending Conversations Gracefully</h2>
                <p>Knowing how to end a conversation is just as important as knowing how to start one.</p>
                
                <h3>When to End a Conversation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The conversation has naturally reached its conclusion</li>
                    <li>You need to leave for external reasons</li>
                    <li>The conversation isn't clicking for either party</li>
                    <li>You feel uncomfortable for any reason</li>
                    <li>The other person is behaving inappropriately</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Polite Exit Lines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>"It was great chatting with you! I need to head out now."</li>
                    <li>"I've enjoyed our conversation, but I should get going. Take care!"</li>
                    <li>"I have to run, but this was a nice talk. Have a good one!"</li>
                    <li>"I'm going to call it a night. Nice meeting you!"</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>When to Exit Without Explanation</h3>
                <p>In some situations, you don't owe an explanation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If someone is being harassing or abusive</li>
